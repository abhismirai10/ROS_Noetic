## Introduction

This repository contains a series of tutorials to help you learn ROS Noetic. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, these tutorials will guide you through the process of building and deploying your own ROS-based applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with these tutorials, you need to have ROS Noetic installed on your system. You can follow the [official installation guide](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation) to set up your ROS environment.

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhismirai10/ros_noetic_tutorials.git
cd ros_noetic_tutorials
```

## Basic Concepts

### Nodes and Topics

Learn how to create and manage nodes in ROS. Nodes are the basic building blocks of a ROS system.
Understand how to use topics to communicate between nodes.

- **Python**: [talker.py](talker_listener/scripts/talker.py)
- **C++**: [talker.cpp](talker_listener/src/talker.cpp)
- **Python**: [listener.py](talker_listener/scripts/listener.py)
- **C++**: [listener.cpp](talker_listener/src/listener.py)

### Services

Discover how to create services for synchronous communication.

- **Python**: [services/server.py](scripts/server.py)
- **C++**: [services/server.cpp](src/server.cpp)

### Parameters

Learn how to use parameters to configure your nodes.

- **Python**: [parameters/param_tutorial.py](scripts/param_tutorial.py)
- **C++**: [parameters/param_tutorial.cpp](src/param_tutorial.cpp)

## Intermediate Concepts

### Actions

Explore how to implement actions for long-running tasks.

- **Python**: [actions/client.py](scripts/client.py)
- **C++**: [actions/client.cpp](src/client.cpp)

### Launch Files

Use launch files to start multiple nodes simultaneously.

- **Launch**: [launch/tutorial.launch](launch/tutorial.launch)

### Dynamic Reconfigure

Learn how to change parameters at runtime.

- **Python**: [dynamic_reconfigure/server.py](scripts/dynamic_reconfigure_server.py)
- **C++**: [dynamic_reconfigure/server.cpp](src/dynamic_reconfigure_server.cpp)

## Advanced Concepts

### MoveIt

Dive into MoveIt for advanced motion planning and manipulation.

- **Tutorial**: [moveit/moveit_tutorial.md](moveit/moveit_tutorial.md)

### Navigation

Implement navigation algorithms for autonomous robots.

- **Tutorial**: [navigation/navigation_tutorial.md](navigation/navigation_tutorial.md)

### Perception

Integrate perception capabilities into your ROS applications.

- **Tutorial**: [perception/perception_tutorial.md](perception/perception_tutorial.md)

## Example Projects

Check out these example projects that combine multiple concepts.

- **Project 1**: [examples/project1](examples/project1)
- **Project 2**: [examples/project2](examples/project2)
